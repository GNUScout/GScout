My experiences at the time of preparing the Final Grade Project have been very successful, although at the beginning
(before starting the project) I was afraid of how to face, and that being used to working in groups and helping
each other to get by with a problem, the fact that distressed me do it myself, but it was not the case, with assistance from
tutor, and several hours of research and investigation looking for solutions to the proposed problems caused the project to go forward.\\

On the other hand the project I chose, to create an application for managing Scout groups, I found very complete, to the
throughout the project touched many contents that were taught in the race's degree in Computer Science. Within what is
software architecture, using the Template-View model offered by Django. We work with a quirky version,
Django-nonrel, to use non-relational database because the deployment is made with Google App Engine, and this technology
only supports non-relational database based on the BigTable model. Apart from this, we use integration also
with Google APIs such as Google + for authentication and access to personal data of users, and Google Drive API to extend
application functions and can export data to spreadsheet documents in Drive. Also in web design are used
CSS for customizations, and code fragments in JavaScript and jQuery to create dynamism in the appearance and interface of the website,
while downloading some features on the client.\\

Another thing I found interesting is that the project is being developed to meet the expectations and needs of an real Scout organization
, so we had several meetings with them, to collect requirements, show progress, adapt to the client,
refocus the project if necessary, etc.. This me I bring a lot of experience when it comes to see more or less how are the cycles of
software development in a real environment.\\

As for future jobs as has been commented in previous chapters, the application development focused on meeting the basic functions
concerning scout members management, while retaining a vision in order to gradually increase functionality of GScout
to meet the needs that originally Aguere 70 Scout organization gave us, for example such as modules to incorporate the treasury, library, waiting lists, etc..\\

Therefore we can say that GScout is an open application and is fully prepared to add more functionality, with only the fact of annexing
modules to the application.
