This is the sandbox directory for my `Google Summer of Code`__
project, which aims to make Docutils ready for documenting Python
packages with reStructuredText.  Please read the original application_
for the full details.

I am working full-time on this during summer 2007 (also see the
time-line_); David Goodger is kindly mentoring me.

Everyone: Please feel free to edit ahead, make changes, and add your
comments in this sandbox.  This is not a personal sandbox -- no need
to ask for permission.
